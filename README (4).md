# Incident Response & Security Breach Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates a brute-force SSH attack and demonstrates
incident detection and response.

## Tools Used

-   Linux Authentication Logs (/var/log/auth.log)
-   UFW Firewall
-   Fail2Ban

## Steps Performed

1.  Simulated repeated failed SSH logins
2.  Analyzed logs using grep
3.  Classified attack as brute-force
4.  Blocked attacker IP
5.  Installed Fail2Ban
6.  Verified system recovery

## Deliverables

-   Incident Response Report (PDF)
-   Incident Timeline
-   Log Screenshot Evidence

## Outcome

Practical understanding of incident handling lifecycle: Identification →
Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned
